          <h2>Jean-Baptiste Poline</h2>
          <p>Since 1990, I have worked on the development of methods for the analysis of functional imaging data (mostly fMRI), and more specifically in the statistical modeling and inference aspects. While a post-doctoral fellow in London (1994-1996), I co-authored SPM, the most popular fMRI statistical analysis software, and developed novel data analysis techniques. I maintain close interactions with neuroscientists to ensure that analysis methods are answering actual needs. I have taught neuroimaging data analysis courses and organized several of these courses in different countries.  I was elected educational chair of the organization for Human Brain Mapping for 2017.  During the past ten years, I have developed an interest in neuroimaging genetics and was responsible for a large multi-centric neuroimaging genetic database (the IMAGEN project) (2006-2011). I have also co-organized several neuroimaging genetics courses. I believe that neuroinformatics is a fundamental part of neuroimaging, and I chair the neuroimaging data sharing task force of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility. I was the co-editor in chief of Frontiers in Brain Imaging Methods for five years, which I co-founded in 2012 partly to address the need for reproducibility and the development of methods in the brain imaging field. I joined the University of California Berkeley in 2012 as a scientist. Currently, I am developing methods for resting-state fMRI and imaging genetic data using clustering techniques, teaching neuroimaging data analysis in Python, and working to better understand and propose solutions to the neuroimaging reproducibility issues. I have joined the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University as an associate professor to work on neuroinformatics, open science and imaging genetic methods. I am the chair of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform and the co-principal investigator of NeuroHub, the neuroinformatics infrastructure of the Mcgill Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives initiative.</p>
          <p>Following an engineering degree in Informatics Electronics and Automatics and a master in Biomathematics, Dr Poline received his PhD in 1993 in the filed of medical imaging analyis. Since 1990, Dr Poline has worked on the development of methods for the analysis of functional imaging data (mostly fMRI), and more specifically in the statistical modeling and inference aspects. While a post-doctoral fellow in London (1994-1996), he co-authored SPM, a popular fMRI statistical analysis software, and developed novel data analysis techniques.

          <p>In the years 2000, Dr Poline activities turned into  neuroinformatics as a fundamental part of neuroimaging, and he chairs the neuroimaging data sharing task force of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility. He has recently been elected the chair of the INCF Council for Training Science and Infrastructure. He was the co-editor in chief of Frontiers in Brain Imaging Methods for five years, which he co-founded in 2012 partly to address the need for reproducibility and the development of methods in the brain imaging field. He joined the University of California Berkeley in 2012 as a senior scientist, developing methods for resting-state fMRI and imaging genetic data using clustering techniques, teaching neuroimaging data analysis in Python, and working to better understand and propose solutions to the neuroimaging reproducibility issues. </p>
          <p>Dr Poline joined the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University as an associate professor in 2017 to work on neuroinformatics, open science and brain imaging or imaging genetic methods. He is currently the co-chair of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform Technical Steering committee and the co-lead of NeuroHub, the neuroinformatics infrastructure of the Mcgill Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives initiative, and the co-director for the Brain Imaging Centre Neuroinformatics. In 2020, he was elected chair of the Council for Training, Science and Infrastructure of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility.</p>
